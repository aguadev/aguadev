* 92124d5 (HEAD, origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) One last parsing test for now.
* 740c545 In fact while we're here, test all packet boundaries
* 9e4b530 Test the the parser does not bork on incomplete headers or incomplete frames in general.
* eed94b8 Get the arguments to copy in the right order, and update frameBuffer.used. The first bug only manifests with frames that must be sent over multiple packets; otherwise, a new frame buffer is cons'ed anyway. The second bug means that message bodies sent over more than one data packet were junk, since they were copied over the existing frame data; but worse, that frames never ended, since the number of data remaining for the frame is calculated from frameBuffer.used.
* 362d31e pull in more recent changes
* fc2625b Allocate the frame writing buffer once, since it gets allocated to max frame size anyway. (The parsing buffers vary in size)
* 1fc2f0a Move this outside the parser constructor, since it has global effect anyway.
* 8e6c757 Use Buffer#copy instead of inspecting every byte, and make the code a bit easier otherwise by using closures to encapsulate the parser state.

| | | * | | | | d941588 Allow channels (queues, exchanges) to be closed
| | | * | | | | 184010d Support multiple consumers on a single connection. Previously, node-amqp would add subscribers to the listeners, which meant rather than the particular subscriber callback being called, every subscriber callback was called.  Now they are distinguished by consumer tag (we supply our own, so we don't have to wait for the server to tell us its generated one, which is awkward in CPS). You can still get the raw messages by listening for rawMessage rather than using subscribe*.
| | | * | | | | 162a20f Give all message properties to the subscriber.  Also allow options to connection.publish, which seems to have been arbitrarily missed out.
| | | * | | | | f3ab522 Update the readme after my changes; in particular wrt the default exchange. Pass the name in the queue creation callback, as it may have been generated and returned by the server.
| | | * | | | | d89e428 Enable the ability to publish to the default exchange; that is, the exchange with the empty name that is used to publish directly to queues.
| | | * | | | | 1538db1 Handle empty queue names (used to indicate that the server should generate a random name).
| | | * | | | | e9bccd7 Fix a couple of mistakes brought to light to publisuing buffers. Namely: a one-off false alarm in serializeInt; and accidentally writing two bytes for a frame end, because 206 isn't an ascii char.
