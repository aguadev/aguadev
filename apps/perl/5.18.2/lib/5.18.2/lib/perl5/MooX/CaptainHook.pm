=head1 NAME

MooX::CaptainHook - hooks for MooX modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   {
      package Local::Role;
      use Moo::Role;
      use MooX::CaptainHook qw(on_application);
      
      on_application {
         print "Local::Role applied to $_\n";
      };
   }
   
   {
      package Local::Class;
      use Moo;
      with 'Local::Role'; # "Local::Role applied to Local::Class"
   }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Although developed to support L<MooX::ClassAttribute>, 
C<MooX::CaptainHook> provides a feature which may be of use to other 
people writing Moo roles and MooX modules.

This module allows you to run callback code when various events happen 
to Moo classes and roles. Callback code for a role will also be copied 
as hooks for any packages that consume that role.

=over

=item C<< on_application { BLOCK } >>

The C<on_application> hook allows you to run a callback when your role
is applied to a class or other role. Within the callback C<< $_[0][0] >>
is set to the name of the package that the role is being applied to.

Also C<< $_[0][1] >> is set to the name of the role being applied, which
may not be the same as the role where the hook was initially defined. (For
example, when role X establishes a hook; role X is consumed by role Y; and
role Y is consumed by class Z. Then the callback code will run twice, once
with C<< $_[0] = [qw(Y X)] >> and once with C<< $_[0] = [qw(Z Y)] >>.)

Altering the C<< $_[0] >> arrayref will alter what is passed to subsequent
callbacks, so is not recommended.

=item C<< on_inflation { BLOCK } >>

The C<on_inflation> hook runs if your class or role is "inflated" to a
full Moose class or role. C<< $_[0][0] >> is the associated metaclass.

Setting C<< $_[0][0] >> to a new meta object should "work" (whatever that
means).

=item C<< is_role($package) >>

Returns a boolean indicating whether the package is a role.

=back

Within callback code blocks, C<< $_ >> is also available as a convenient
alias to C<< $_[0][0] >>.

=head2 Installing Hooks for Other Packages

You can pass a package name as an optional second parameter:

   use MooX::CaptainHook;
   
   MooX::CaptainHook::on_application {
      my ($applied_to, $role) = @_;
      ...;
   } 'Your::Role';
