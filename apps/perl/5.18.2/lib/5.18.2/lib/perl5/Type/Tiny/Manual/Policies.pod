B<< The following stability policy is planned for Type::Tiny 1.000000
and above. This milestone has not yet been reached. >>

=head2 Type::Tiny Stability Policy

Type::Tiny 1.000000 is considered stable. Any changes to the API that
are big enough to I<require> changes to the test suite will be preceded
by a I<< six month >> notice period, with the following exceptions:

=over

=item *

Where a change is necessary to maintain compatibility with new releases
of L<Moose>, L<Moo>, or Perl itself.

=item *

Where a change fixes a contradiction between the implementation and
documentation of Type::Tiny.

=item *

Where a feature is explicitly documented as being "experimental" or
"unstable".

=item *

Improvements to the text of error messages.

=head2 Experimental and Unstable Type::Tiny Features

The following list is currently non-exhaustive.

=over

=item *

L<Type::Tiny> inlining subs (i.e. C<inline_as>) may return a list of
strings (with C<undef> being allowed as the first item on the list).
This is experimental. See L<Type::Utils>.

=item *

The L<parameterizable coercion API|Type::Coercion> is subject to change.

=item *

L<Type::Registry> has L<changes under consideration|Type::Registry/"STATUS">.

=item *

L<Type::Registry>'s ability to import L<MooseX::Types> and L<MouseX::Types>
type libraries is experimental.

=item *
