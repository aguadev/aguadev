This is a line item in a Menu widget.
The display for the MenuItem consists of 3 columns: namely ``Label``, ``Icon`` and the ``Accelerator`` key.
Although Menu can display accelerator keys there is no infrastructure currently to actually catch and execute these accelerators.
The developer is responsible for the key event handler to support this.


See the :ref:`dijit/DropDownMenu <dijit/DropDownMenu>` page for details and examples.
