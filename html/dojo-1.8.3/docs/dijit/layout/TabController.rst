==========================
dijit.layout.TabController
==========================

This is a supporting class for tabs in a :ref:`dijit/layout/TabContainer <dijit/layout/TabContainer>`
without the features for scrolling or showing the Menu listing the tabs.

It's used internally by TabContainers when the tabs are displayed on the left or right rather than the top or bottom,
and can also be used by explicitly specifying the TabContainer.controllerWidget property to the TabContainer constructor.
