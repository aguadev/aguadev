The VerticalRuleLabels widget is used for specifying labels for the :ref:`dijit/form/VerticalRule <dijit/form/VerticalRule>`.
One way of specifying the labels is through a custom defined array of Strings.
To get numeric labels, the minimum and maximum attributes need to be specified.
The labels can also be specified directly as children of the <li> tag.

For examples of using this widget to specify labels refer :ref:`dijit/form/VerticalSlider <dijit/form/VerticalSlider>` and :ref:`dijit/form/VerticalRule <dijit/form/VerticalRule>`.
