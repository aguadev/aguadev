Introduction
============

dijit/_Contained is a mixin sometimes used for children of a :ref:`dijit/_Container <dijit/_Container>`.

It provides methods like getNextSibling() and getPreviousSibling().

However, a widget implementing :ref:`dijit/_Container <dijit/_Container>` can have any type of children,
regardless of whether or not they implement dijit/_Contained.   Thus it's usually not necessary to
extend this class.
