**dojo/store** is an uniform interface for the access and manipulation of stored data. ``dojo/store`` is intended to 
supersede, integrate, and improve upon the :ref:`dojo/data <dojo/data>` API and :ref:`dojox/storage <dojox/storage>` 
API with a simple, easy to implement and extend API, based on 
`HTML5/W3C's IndexedDB object store API <http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#object-store-sync>`_. The ``dojox/storage`` 
API is already a compatible subset of the Dojo object store API.

API
===

Methods
-------

Every method in the API is optional, it's presence indicating support for that feature. Every method can return a promise (except where noted otherwise) to represent an asynchronous completion of the action. (Some of these are still wavering a bit in W3C's object store API):

================================================  =====================================================================
Method                                            Description
================================================  =====================================================================
get(id)                                           Retrieves an object by its identifier, returning the object.

query(query, *options*)                           Queries the store using the provided query.

                                                  The returned value should be an array or a promise with ``forEach()``
                                                  , ``map()``, ``filter()``, ``reduce()``, ``subscribe()``, and 
                                                  optional ``close()`` and ``watch()`` methods, and a ``total`` 
                                                  property (the ``total`` may be a promise). The ``options`` parameter 
                                                  may include the following properties (all are optional):

                                                  * ``start`` - Starting offset
                                                  
                                                  * ``count`` - Number of objects to return
                                                  
                                                  * ``sort`` - This is an array of sort definitions, where each 
                                                    definition contains an ``attribute`` property indicating which 
                                                    property to sort on and a ``descending`` property indicating the 
                                                    direction of sort. 

                                                    For example: ``[{attribute:"price, descending: true}]``. If the 
                                                    sort parameter is omitted, then the natural order of the store may 
                                                    be applied if there is a natural order.

put(object, *options*)                            Saves the given object. The (optional) ``options`` argument may be 
                                                  an object with the following properties (each of these is optional 
                                                  and advisory, stores are not required to implement or respond to 
                                                  each property):

                                                  * ``id`` - Indicates the identity of the object if a new object is 
                                                    created.
                                                  
                                                  * ``before`` - If the collection of objects in the store has a 
                                                    natural ordering, this indicates that the created or updated 
                                                    object should be placed before the object specified by the value 
                                                    of this property. A value of null indicates that the object should 
                                                    be last.
                                                  
                                                  * ``parent`` - If the store is hierarchical (with single parenting) 
                                                    this property indicates the new parent of the created or updated 
                                                    object.
                                                  
                                                  * ``overwrite`` - If this is provided as a boolean it indicates that 
                                                    the object should or should not overwrite an existing object. A 
                                                    value of ``true`` indicates that a new object should not be 
                                                    created, the operation should update an existing object. A value 
                                                    of ``false`` indicates that an existing object should not be 
                                                    updated, a new object should be created (which is the same as an 
                                                    ``add()`` operation). When this property is not provided, either 
                                                    an update or creation is acceptable.

add(object, *options*)                            Create a new object. The (optional) ``options`` argument is defined 
                                                  the same as ``put()`` (except ``overwrite`` is assumed to be 
                                                  ``false``).

remove(id)                                        Delete the object by ``id``.

getIdentity(object)                               Returns an ``object``'s identity

queryEngine(query, *options*)                     This takes a query and query options and returns a function that 
                                                  can execute the provided ``query`` on a JavaScript array. The 
                                                  ``queryEngine`` may be replace to provide more sophisticated 
                                                  querying capabilities. The returned query function may have a 
                                                  ``matches`` property that can be used to determine if an object 
                                                  matches the query.

transaction()                                     Starts a transaction and returns a transaction object.

                                                  The transaction object should include:

                                                  * ``commit()`` - Commits all the changes that took place during the 
                                                    transaction.
                                                  
                                                  * ``abort()`` - Aborts all the changes that took place during the 
                                                    transaction.

                                                  Note that a store user might not call ``transaction()`` prior to 
                                                  using ``put``, ``delete``, etc. in which case these operations 
                                                  effectively could be thought of as "auto-commit" style actions. Also 
                                                  note that within a transaction, notification events may still occur 
                                                  immediately, rather after a commit. Consequently, aborting a 
                                                  transaction may require sending new notification events to notify of 
                                                  the rollback of the data.

getChildren(object, *options*)                    Returns the children of an object. The ``options`` parameter may 
                                                  include the same properties as ``query()`` options.

getMetadata(object)                               Returns any metadata about the object.

                                                  This may include attribution, cache directives, history, or version 
                                                  information.

Properties
----------

===========  ================  ========================================================================================
Property     Type              Description
===========  ================  ========================================================================================
idProperty   String            Name of the property to use as the identifier
data         Array of Objects  If the store has a collection of cached objects, it can make this available in this 
                               property. This is included so an additional layer could add referential integrity 
                               cleanup on object deletion (which is a pain to implement).
===========  ================  ========================================================================================

Returned Objects
================

Objects returned from a ``dojo/store`` should primarily be treated as normal hash objects and have standard JavaScript 
properties to access their data and modify their data. However, methods may also be defined on the objects returned by 
the store (once again, they are optional). These methods should **not** be the object's own properties (
``hasOwnProperty(methodName)`` should return ``false``), but rather should be inherited from one of the object's 
prototypes). This is to ensure ease of enumeration of data properties.  In particular, a store may choose to return 
objects that are instances of :ref:`dojo/Stateful <dojo/Stateful>` (although none of the core stores do this).

Observing Result Sets
=====================

When a store is wrapped with ``dojo/store/Observable``, one can listen for changes in data through the observe method on the result set (the object returned from a query). The observe method has the following signature:

========================================================  =============================================================
Method                                                    Description
========================================================  =============================================================
observe(listener, includeObjectUpdates)                   The listener function is called with following arguments:

                                                          .. js ::

                                                            listener(object, removedFrom, insertedInto);

                                                          * The ``object`` parameter indicates the object that was 
                                                            create, modified, or deleted.

                                                          * The ``removedFrom`` parameter indicates the index in the 
                                                            result array where the object used to be. If the value is 
                                                            ``-1``, then the object is an addition to this result set 
                                                            (due to a new object being created, or changed such that 
                                                            it is a part of the result set).

                                                          * The ``insertedInto`` parameter indicates the index in the 
                                                            result array where the object should be now. If the value 
                                                            is ``-1``, then the object is a removal from this result 
                                                            set (due to an object being deleted, or changed such that 
                                                            it is not a part of the result set).

                                                          The ``includeObjectUpdates`` argument indicates whether or
                                                          not to include updates to objects that don't affect the
                                                          inclusion or order of the changed object. If this is not set
                                                          to true, object updates that don't result in addition,
                                                          removal, or change in order won't trigger the listener.

close()                                                   When ``close()`` is called on a result set, notifications 
                                                          will no longer be fired.
========================================================  =============================================================

Modules
=======

The following stores, store wrappers, and utilities are part of Dojo Core. These provide a solid base of good modular 
components for using stores and building more complex store technology. The following two core stores based on the 
typical pattern of in-memory and server-based data stores:

* :ref:`dojo/store/Memory <dojo/store/Memory>`

  An in-memory object store that queries, modifies, and accesses client-side in-memory data. This can be created with 
  a simple array of JavaScript objects.

* :ref:`dojo/store/JsonRest <dojo/store/JsonRest>`

  An server-oriented JSON/REST object store that queries, modifies, and accesses data through RESTful HTTP requests. 
  This would fulfill the conceptual role of :ref:`dojox/data/JsonRestStore <dojox/data/JsonRestStore>`, 
  :ref:`dojox/data/QueryReadStore <dojox/data/QueryReadStore>` and 
  :ref:`dojox/data/ServiceStore <dojox/data/ServiceStore>`.

There is also an adapter store for using legacy ``dojo/data`` stores with the new API:

* :ref:`dojo/store/DataStore <dojo/store/DataStore>`

And there is an adapter that allows you to use a new ``dojo/store`` with the old ``dojo/data`` API:

* :ref:`dojo/data/ObjectStore <dojo/data/ObjectStore>`

We are also moving in the direction of providing composable functionality by providing store "wrappers" or store 
"middleware" that takes a store and adds functionality. Several key store wrappers:

* :ref:`dojo/store/Observable <dojo/store/Observable>`

  This augments a store with the data monitoring capability, adding a observe method on the query result sets that 
  notifies of data changes.

* :ref:`dojo/store/Cache <dojo/store/Cache>`

  Adds caching capability to the store. This eliminates the need for a base store to deal with caching concerns.

With this one can easily mix and match wrappers and base stores to achieve various types of functionality. A common 
pattern may be:

.. js ::

  require(["dojo/store/Memory", "dojo/store/Observable"], function(Memory, Observable){
    var store = Observable(new Memory({ data: someData }));
  });

There are also a couple of utility modules:

* :ref:`dojo/store/util/SimpleQueryEngine <dojo/store/util/SimpleQueryEngine>`

  This is basic query engine that provides simple object hash style filtering or function based filtering.

* :ref:`dojo/store/util/QueryResults <dojo/store/util/QueryResults>`

  This utility will take an array or a promise for an array and return a result set object with all the standard 
  iterative methods that should be available on a result set (``forEach()``, ``map()``, and ``filter()``).

Design
======

Notification Rational
---------------------

The purpose of using this style of notifications in ``dojo/store`` (instead of the ``dojo/data`` notification style of 
events on the store) is to deal with several problems that have been observed with ``dojo/data`` notifications. First, 
it neglects that fact that most of the time users only want to listen to events from the queried subset of the items 
in the store, and that subscriptions can be costly. While subscriptions are usually cheap on the client side, *carte 
blanche* subscriptions can actually be very expensive on the server side (with Comet-style notifications), forcing the 
server to send excessive events and then forcing the client to filter them.

Also, this subscription deals with an issue that has been experienced with ``dojo/data`` in that often new items and 
item changes can affect query results in ways that the widget can not understand because the queries are opaque to the 
widget. For example with a grid, all ``onNew`` items result in an addition of a row, regardless of whether they are a 
new item and actually match the query. The grid itself knows nothing (and should know nothing) of how queries work, 
and so it can't filter these events. By putting notifications on the query action itself, notifications can be stated 
in terms of how they affect a given query result set, which is what the widget ultimately cares about.

Different event names have been used to be clear that the semantics are different than the ``dojo/data`` notifications.
The distinctive events are defined by how they affect the query result set (not whether they have come into or gone 
out of existence by some definition of existence). Also, the ``onUpdate()`` applies to an entire object, not per 
property modifications.

Design Goals
------------

* It should be very easy to for people to implement their own object stores, essentially one should easily be able to 
  write something up handle the communication to their server without having to deal with much more than writing the 
  :ref:`dojo/request <dojo/request>` calls. Higher level functionality can be built on this. A key to this strategy is 
  a very simple API, that requires a minimal amount of required complexity to implement.

* Maintain the same level of functionality that :ref:`dojo/data <dojo/data>` provided. While there are very few core 
  parts of the object store API that MUST be implemented, there are numerous parts that can be implemented to 
  incrementally add functionality. Optional functionality is determined through feature detection (checking to see if 
  a method exists). Having lots of optional features does shift some complexity from the store implementors to the 
  anyone who wishes to use stores in a completely generic fashion. However, it is believed that the widgets are the 
  primary generic store users, and that most application developers are working with a known store, with a known set 
  of implemented features. In particular, if they know they are using a sync store, the interaction with the store 
  becomes extremely simple. Every method should be optional, and the presence of the method indicates support for that 
  feature. However, practically one would at least need to implement ``get()`` and ``query()``, a store without read 
  capabilities is pretty useless, but that should be self-evident.

* Every method can be implemented sync or async. The interface is the exactly the same for sync and async except that 
  async returns promises/Deferreds instead of plain values. The interface requires no other knowledge of specific 
  callbacks to operate.

* Objects returned from the data store (via ``query()`` or ``get()``) should be plain JavaScript objects whose 
  properties can be typically accessed and modified through standard property access.
