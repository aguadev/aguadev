**dojo/date/locale** offers a library of localization methods to format and parse dates and times.

Introduction
============

When you want to present dates or times to the user, JavaScript only knows how to handle a single locale and language,
and the actual format is implementation-dependent, and your web application has no control over these choices.

Dojo comes with a powerful library to format and parse dates and times using local language and conventions, from your
choice of hundreds of locales, or as you would like using custom date/time patterns.

Features
========

``dojo/date/locale`` offers the following methods:

* :ref:`dojo/date/locale::addCustomFormats() <dojo/date/locale/addCustomFormats>`

  routines.

* :ref:`dojo/date/locale::format() <dojo/date/locale/format>`

  Formats a Date object as a String, using locale-specific settings or custom patterns.

* :ref:`dojo/date/locale::getNames() <dojo/date/locale/getNames>`

  Used to get localized strings from ``dojo/cldr`` for day or month names.

* :ref:`dojo/date/locale::isWeekend() <dojo/date/locale/isWeekend>`
