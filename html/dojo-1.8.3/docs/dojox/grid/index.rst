Grids are familiar in the client/server development world. Basically a grid is a kind of mini spreadsheet, commonly used to display details on master-detail forms. From HTML terms, a grid is a "super-table" with its own scrollable viewport.

Dojo Toolkit offers three different Grid widgets:

* :ref:`dojox.grid.DataGrid <dojox/grid/DataGrid>`

  A visual grid/table much like a spreadsheet.

* :ref:`dojox.grid.EnhancedGrid <dojox/grid/EnhancedGrid>`

  An enhanced version of the base grid, which extends it in numerous useful ways. ``New in 1.4``

* :ref:`dojox.grid.TreeGrid <dojox/grid/TreeGrid>`

  This grid offers support for collapsible rows and model-based (:ref:`dijit.tree.ForestStoreModel <dijit/tree/ForestStoreModel>`) structure. ``New in 1.4``

Old (deprecated) dojox.grid.Grid
================================

Dojo Toolkit V1.1 offered an old version of the grid as dojox.grid.Grid. This old version has changed with Dojo Toolkit V1.2 but is still available for compatible reasons. It is now bundled in the dojox/grid directory as a tarball archive for those who would like to continue using the deprecated (V1.1) Grid.
