dojox.rpc.Service is the foundation of most :ref:`RPC <dojox/rpc>` transportation. To use a Service, you need an SMD. Defining the 
SMD is a separate discussion, so for now we'll reuse some pre-defined SMD's available in the RPC project's :ref:`SMDLibrary/ 
<dojox/rpc/SMDLibrary>` folder.

First, you need the code:

.. js ::

  dojo.require("dojox.rpc.Service");

There are several transports/envelopes that are defined in separate modules to minimize the size of dojox.rpc.Service. These must 
also be loaded if they are used by the SMD:

* JSONP Transport requires :ref:`dojo.io.script <dojo/io/script>`

* REST transport requires :ref:`dojox.rpc.Rest <dojox/rpc/Rest>`

* JSON-RPC-2.0 and JSON-RPC-1.0 envelopes require :ref:`dojox.rpc.JsonRPC <dojox/rpc/JsonRPC>`

All of the provided SMDLibrary SMD's are based on JSONP, and consequently require :ref:`dojo.io.script <dojo/io/script>`. If you 
define your own SMD with a local target endpoint, :ref:`dojo.io.script <dojo/io/script>` is not needed.

Starting a Service
==================

Service is a constructor, returning a pointer to the API defined in the SMD.

.. js ::

  var goog = new dojox.rpc.Service(dojo.moduleUrl("dojox.rpc", "SMDLibrary/google.smd"));

The ``google.smd`` file is located in a fixed location, available from :ref:`dojo.moduleUrl <dojo/moduleUrl>` calculations.

If the argument passed to ``new Service()`` is an object, it is assumed to be the direct service definition:

.. js ::

  var goog = null;
  dojo.xhrGet({
     url: dojo.moduleUrl("dojox.rpc", "SMDLibrary/google.smd"),
     handleAs: "json",
     load: function(data){
         goog = new dojox.rpc.Service(data);
     }
  });

Or if it is a string, it will be treated as a URL, and the above code will be run for you:

.. js ::

  // assuming your dojox/ is in js/
  var goog = new dojox.rpc.Service("js/dojox/rpc/SMDLibrary/google.smd");

Additionally, in 1.2 you are able to take advantage of :ref:`scriptFrame <dojox/io/scriptFrame>` transport, which will divert all 
traffic through a hidden iframe, preventing other :ref:`io.script <dojo/io/script>` processes from being 'blocked' while they wait 
on response data.
Simply provide a ``frameDoc`` attribute and passed as an optional parameter to the constructor:

.. js ::

  dojo.require("dojox.io.scriptFrame");
  dojo.require("dojox.rpc.Service");
  var goog = new dojox.rpc.Service("js/dojox/rpc/SMDLibrary/google.smd", {
      frameDoc:"someIframeID"
  });

An iframe will be created if one cannot be found.

Using a Service
===============

Service, like io.script, works around Dojo's built in :ref:`Deferred <dojo/Deferred>` system, providing asynchronous communication 
around a familiar API. Once we've created our Service from an SMD, the methods defined in the SMD are available through the return 
handle provided.

.. js ::

  var goog = new dojox.rpc.Service(dojo.moduleUrl("dojox.rpc.SMDLibrary", "google.smd"));
  goog.webSearch({ q:"Dojo Toolkit" }).then(
      function(data){
         // in this particular RPC call, the results you seek are:
         console.log(data.responseData.results);
      },
      function(err){
         // an error occurred. timeout, bad data, etc.
      }
  );

This will trigger a web search for the phrase "Dojo Toolkit", and fire your callback function when complete.

If you are unfamiliar with :ref:`Deferreds <dojo/Deferred>`, you should dig deeper. You will thank us later.

Creating your own SMD
=====================

Please see :ref:`the SMD specification <dojox/rpc/smd>` for a definition of the SMD format 
and how to define your own.
