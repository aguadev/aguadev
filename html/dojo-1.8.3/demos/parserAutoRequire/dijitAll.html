		<p>
			This particular content pane invokes the loading of <span
				class="code">dijit/dijit-all</span> via declarative markup. This is
			intended to simulate that invoking of loading an application layer
			from a custom build. Once your application layer is loaded, if your
			module is included in that, then it will not be loaded again.
		</p>
		<p>This means that you can load application layers declaratively
			and only when first needed by including them in your declaritive
			markup.</p>
		<p>
			The way this is accomplish is that the parser now supports the
			ability to run the <span class="code">require();</span> command in
			declarative markup without instantiating an object by using the <span
				class="code">data-dojo-command</span> attribute like this:
		</p>
		<pre>
&lt;div data-dojo-command="require" data-dojo-args="dijit/dijit-all"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
	</div>
