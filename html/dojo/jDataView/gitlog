| | | | | * a82ba55 Bunch of performance improvements. Using [String->]Array->(Buffer|ArrayBuffer) conversion chain for best performance on used platform. String buffers are now implicitly converted to inner byte buffer formats too: for getters, this means no need to convert chars to bytes on each read access; for setters, this means no need to rebuild strings using slice+concat on each write access (since JS Strings are immutable and it was the only way for modifying their contents). Typed arrays are now used even if values are misaligned (operating on sliced part of byte buffer in that case). Added jDataView.wrapBuffer function for converting any supported input buffer (than can be String or any Array-like type) to best suitable inner type; jDataView.createBuffer is left only for backward compatibility. Added jDataView.prototype.slice function for retrieving jDataView on part of original one (supports options for pointing to the same memory buffer or copying data into new one). getBytes now supports call w/o length argument (reads to the end of buffer by default).
